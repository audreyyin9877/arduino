# Arduino sketches and Bonsai layouts to control laboratory equipment
---


üìñ Introduction
---

The repository hosts Arduino sketches and bonsai layouts used at the [LeDoux Lab](https://www.cns.nyu.edu/ledoux/index.html) to control lab equipment and data acquisition pipelines in several behavioral experiments.


‚ö†Ô∏è This **repo is in development** and _**bugs may exist**_ in the code despite the relentless will to remove them! Make sure to run all appropriate tests before using it.

The contents of this repo will require one or more of the frameworks below:

- [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/): Opensource framework to interact with microcontrollers.  
- [Bonsai](https://bonsai-rx.org/): Opensource data acquisition software.  
- [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/): Software used to draw the wiring schematics.


‚úèÔ∏è Resources

The easiest way to get started is by completing the projects of the (awesome) [arduino starting kit](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-starter-kit-multi-language). It contains several interesting projects that introduce the newcomers to all that is needed (including coding) to build great stuff!

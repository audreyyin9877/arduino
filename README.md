# Bonsai and Arduino

The repository holds several arduino scripts and bonsai layouts that I use to control the hardware and data aquisition pipelines used in my behavioral tasks.

(This repo is being continuously developed and errors/bugs may exist in the code despite my relentless will to remove them!)

## Software

[Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/): Framework used to interact with single-board microcontrollers.  

[Bonsai](https://bonsai-rx.org/): Data aquisition software.  

[Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/): software used to design the electronics and schematics used in the tasks.


## Contents

- `arduino_procotols/`: contains ready to use scripts and also wiring schematics of the hardware.  
- `bonsai_layouts/`: contain bonsai workflows for data acquisition and storage.  
- `test-sketch/`: contains small scripts to control electronic components.
